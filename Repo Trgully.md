# SAP Mentors Lemonaid

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sapmentors/lemonaid.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sapmentors/lemonaid)

## Purpose

Historically, there have been several Excel sheets containing mentor details, each for its own purpose. Unfortunately these sheets were often out of sync, causing most sheets not to be up-to-date. 

To get the pac ready for the age of digital transformation, the mentor details have to be centrally managed. This will allow the program team to always have an up-to-date overview of the mentors, and allows them to easily slice and dice mentor details. 

To keep the data up-to-date, mentors can update their own profile, which in turn is enriched with details pulled in from several sources (e.g. mentor profile image and geocode addresses).
